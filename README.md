### Rules:
- The game is played on a grid that's 4 by 4 by 4 squares.
- You are **X**, and your friend (or the computer in this case) is **O**. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally across the face or the cube) is the winner.
- When all 64 squares are full, the game is over. The game ends in a tie if no player has 3 marks in a row.

### Instructions:
- Click an empty box to make your move
- Right Click to restart a game when the game ends.
- Hit SPACE to toggle between modes.
